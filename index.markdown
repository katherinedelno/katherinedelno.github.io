# Hi, there.

I’m Katherine Delno, an M.S. in Statistics graduate from the University of Washington. I build clean, reproducible data science workflows in Python/R and explain results clearly to non-technical partners. This site highlights selected projects, experience, and academic work.

I’m currently exploring roles in data science and applied statistics.
