My name is [Katherine Delno](/about). I'm a recent M.S. Statistics graduate from the University of Washington. I build clean, reproducible workflows in Python/R and translate results clearly for non-technical audiences.
This site showcases my selected [projects](/projects), [experience](/experience), and [academic background](/education).

I’m currently volunteering with the Global Council for Responsible AI (GCRAI). I also occasionally offer one-on-one tutoring in AP Statistics and introductory statistics; inquiries welcome. Alongside this, I’m actively pursuing data science and machine learning roles.
