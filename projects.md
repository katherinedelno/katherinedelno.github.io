**RandomForestSpecCheck: A Permutation-Based Random Forest Diagnostic for LMMs** 03/2025 
<br>
Developed a novel diagnostic method for detecting model misspecification in linear mixed models (LMMs) using random forests and permutation testing. Applied to simulated and real-world data to evaluate performance under various violations of model assumptions.

**A Conformal Prediction Framework for Multi-Label Movie Genre Classification** 03/2025 
<br>
Led development of a multi-label movie genre classifier by fine-tuning a lightweight transformer and integrating conformal prediction to produce calibrated sets of genre tags, striking an effective balance between capturing all relevant labels and avoiding spurious ones.
<br>

**Fine-Tuning BERT Models for Recipe Classification: An Evaluation of Transformer-Based NLP Approaches** 02/2025 
<br>
Fine-tuned transformer-based NLP architectures to classify recipes by dietary category, leveraging transfer learning to capture rich culinary semantics and implementing an end-to-end ML workflow while embedding-driven feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and rigorous cross-validation to deliver a robust, generalizable classifier.
