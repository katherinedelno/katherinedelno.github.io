<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

  <p>
    I’m Katherine Delno, a statistician by training (M.S., University of Washington) who enjoys turning careful analysis into decisions people can actually use. I build clear, reproducible workflows in Python and R and translate results into plain language so collaborators don’t need a stats background to act. I care about honest uncertainty and work that others can re-run and trust. I’m currently volunteering with the Global Council for Responsible AI (GCRAI), supporting executive leadership and early framework efforts, and I’m exploring data scientist and machine learning roles where I can contribute that same rigor and clarity.

  Outside of work, you can find me in Seattle, usually baking, tuning my espresso setup, making ceramics, or hanging out with my cat, Blue
