  <p>
I recently graduated from the University of Washington with my Master's in Statistics and am actively seeking data science or statistics roles in the Bay Area. My graduate education provided a rigorous foundation in statistical inference, modeling, and machine learning. Some of the projects I've worked on include building predictive models and conducting simulation studies in R and Python, using BERT for NLP-based text classification tasks, applying conformal prediction for reliable uncertainty quantification, and developing a novel random forest-based method to detect model misspecification in linear mixed models. Through my experience as a teaching assistant for introductory statistics and as a mentor in statistical learning, I’ve honed my ability to clearly communicate complex concepts. I look forward to applying my analytical skills and passion for solving statistical and machine learning problems in a collaborative environment.

Outside of statistics and data science, I’m currently living in Seattle following the completion of my graduate school, but I’m hoping to return to the Bay Area, where I was born. In my free time, I enjoy baking, refining my espresso setup, ceramics, gothic calligraphy, and spending time with my cat, [Blue](/assets/img/blue.jpeg). I have a deep appreciation for intentional, atmospheric design—whether in interiors, clothing, or everyday arrangements. I’m drawn to quiet balance and subtle pattern, both in the visual rhythms of the world around me and in the quiet logic that gives them form.
