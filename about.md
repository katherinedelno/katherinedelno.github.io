I recently graduated from the University of Washington with my Master's in Statistics and am actively seeking data science or statistics roles in the Bay Area. My graduate education provided a rigorous foundation in statistical inference, modeling, and machine learning. Some of the projects I've worked on include building predictive models and conducting simulation studies in R and Python, using BERT for NLP-based text classification tasks, applying conformal prediction for reliable uncertainty quantification, and developing a novel random forest-based method to detect model misspecification in linear mixed models. Through my experience as a teaching assistant for introductory statistics and as a mentor in statistical learning, Iâ€™ve honed my ability to clearly communicate complex concepts. I look forward to applying my analytical skills and passion for solving statistical and machine learning problems in a collaborative environment.
