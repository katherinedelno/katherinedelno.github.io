title: Private AP® Statistics Instruction
permalink: /ap-stats/

**Overview**<br>
I provide one-on-one AP Statistics instruction for high school students. Sessions are structured and AP-aligned, with emphasis on correct procedure selection, careful condition checks, and clear, rubric-appropriate written conclusions. Meetings are held over Zoom. Notes and materials are organized in a private shared folder.
<br><br>

**My Background**<br>
I hold an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Washington and a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Nevada, Reno, with formal training in probability, statistical inference, and regression modeling. My graduate training at UW provides a rigorous theoretical foundation that carries through my instruction, from correct procedure selection to well-justified conclusions. I’ve taught statistics in both structured university settings and one-on-one formats. As a graduate teaching assistant for large introductory statistics courses, I led weekly discussion sections, developed instructional materials, and supported students in producing clear, defensible statistical reasoning. I also mentored through UW’s Directed Reading Program, designing and teaching a one-on-one short course in statistical learning.
<br><br>

**My Teaching Approach**<br>
My instruction is structured and methodical. I teach students how to translate prompts into the appropriate procedure, verify assumptions and conditions precisely, and communicate results using language consistent with AP expectations. The goal is not only to obtain correct answers, but to build reliable habits of setup, justification, interpretation, and statistical writing.

I’m equally attentive to the learning environment. Many capable students lose points due to uncertainty under time pressure, disorganized work, or inconsistent written communication. Sessions are designed to be calm and focused: questions are taken seriously, mistakes are handled constructively, and confidence is built alongside skill.
<br><br>

**Who This Is For**<br>
I primarily support AP Statistics students who want structured, AP-aligned instruction and clearer statistical communication. This is a good fit for students who want to improve method selection, setup, interpretation, and rubric-aligned writing.
<br><br>

**Course Support Options**<br>
My default model is a structured weekly program that functions like a mini-class: direct instruction, guided practice, and an independent check to confirm the student can execute without prompts. All sessions are billed monthly; invoices are sent on the 1st of each month.
<br>

**Structured Course Support — $180/week**<br>
Weekly instruction with organized session notes. Appropriate for students who want consistent teaching and guided practice without between-session coaching.<br>
- **Weekly 90-minute structured sessions (pre-planned and instructor-led)** aligned with the student’s course pacing and customized to the specific skill gaps and recurring errors I observe. Each session includes:<br>
  - **Mini-lesson** on definitions, conditions, and the standard AP workflow/justification structure.<br>
  - **Guided problem-solving** on representative AP-style problems with targeted prompts and corrections.<br>
  - **End-of-session quiz** in the final 10-15 minutes of each session, followed by a quick review together to confirm what’s correct, fix errors, and clarify any sticking points.<br>
- **Session notes and solutions** uploaded after each meeting (mini-lesson summary, worked problems, and independent check solutions) so students can review and reference everything between meetings.<br>
- **TI-84 Plus CE integration** so students learn to accurately and efficiently use key statistics and probability functions so they can handle complex calculations confidently and avoid avoidable test-day mistakes.<br>
- **Best fit:** Students who mainly need clear instruction and guided practice and can follow through on practice independently.
<br>

**Premium Course Support — $220/week**<br>
Includes everything in Structured Course Support, plus a fuller feedback loop between sessions.<br>
- **Weekly assigned problem sets (typically 6-10 problems)** selected to reinforce the exact skills we covered and expose common AP-style traps. 
- **Written feedback** on method choice, setup, interpretation, and statistical communication.<br>
- **Between-session support** for brief questions or clarifications on weekdays between sessions so the student doesn’t get stuck and lose momentum. Weekend messages are welcome too, but may have longer response times.<br>
- **Living "method sheet"** that summarizes when to use each procedure, key conditions, and standard wording for justification/interpretation.<br>
- **Monthly parent update (optional)** via a 20-minute virtual check-in (meeting or call) or a brief written progress note covering what we’ve worked on, current strengths/weak spots, and next steps.<br>
- **Best fit:** Students who benefit from accountability, structured practice, and feedback between sessions, especially when the course moves quickly or expectations are unclear.
<br>

**As-Needed Support (limited availability) — $120/hr**<br>
For students who are generally self-directed and want occasional support with specific questions (homework, quiz/test review, or a current topic). This format is student-led rather than a weekly instructional program.<r>
- **Targeted problem support** based on the student's attempted work.<br>
- **Correct procedure selection and clean setup** including condition checks, calculator steps, and rubric-aligned conclusions.<br>
- **Not ideal for ongoing skill-building** when a student needs regular instruction, independent checks, assigned practice, or accountability.
- **Best fit:** Self-directed students who come prepared with specific questions and do not need weekly structure.
<br><br>

**Technology**<br>
For best results, sessions follow a consistent virtual setup that supports step-by-step instruction, clear notation, and organized materials.<br>
- **Zoom-based sessions** delivered live.
- **Digital whiteboard** with live handwriting and annotation for step-by-step setup and reasoning.
- **Private shared folder** (Dropbox) for session notes and materials; parents may be added upon request.
- **Student setup** should include a quiet location, stable internet, a TI-84 Plus CE (recommended), and a consistent note-taking method.

**Next Steps**<br>
If you’d like to discuss fit, you can email me at [delnokatherine@gmail.com](mailto:delnokatherine@gmail.com) or schedule a 15-minute meet-and-greet using the link below. After the initial conversation, I’ll recommend the most appropriate support option and share scheduling details.

I accept a limited number of students each academic year; once capacity is reached, I maintain a short waitlist.

**Academic Progress & No Guaranteed Outcomes**<br>
My goal is to help students build durable understanding, stronger problem-solving habits, and clearer statistical communication. I provide structured instruction, targeted practice, and actionable feedback aligned with AP expectations and the student’s course pacing.

I cannot and do not guarantee any specific grade, test score, class placement, or AP exam result. Outcomes depend on factors outside my control, including the student’s consistency between sessions, completion of assigned work, attendance, classroom instruction and grading policies, assessment difficulty, pacing, and test-day conditions.

By enrolling, families are purchasing instructional time and academic coaching, not a promised outcome. I’m happy to discuss goals up front and adjust our approach as we learn what supports the student most effectively.<br>
