#### **Tutoring Formats**
Two ways to work together: **Office Hours** offer reactive, as-needed support for current assignments, quizzes, and tests. **Structured Teaching** is proactive, one-on-one instruction with planned mini-lessons, custom handouts, targeted practice with solutions, and rubric-aligned AP reasoning—built to stay ahead of class pacing, close gaps early, and build exam-ready habits.
<br><br>

**Structured Teaching Session — $120/hr**<br>
Structured Teaching Sessions are proactive and pre-planned around the AP curriculum, class pacing, and anticipated challenges. They focus on building skills, mastering AP-specific language, and reinforcing concepts before gaps form. This style of session is more in line with private, one-on-one teaching. 

- Sessions are pre-planned around the AP curriculum, class pacing, and anticipated challenges
- Includes short, targeted mini-lessons on upcoming or difficult topics, plus AP exam strategies
- Includes guided notes and a targeted practice set (with solutions) that the student keeps
- Integrates AP-specific vocabulary and exam-style reasoning
- Provides guided practice with AP-style questions and immediate feedback
- Tutor proactively identifies gaps before they cause issues
- Requires substantial preparation outside of sessions to create lectures, select topics, and source materials
- Best for students new to AP coursework or who benefit from consistent structure
- Designed to ensure the student can both solve problems and clearly explain reasoning in the style required to earn maximum points on the AP exam
- Billed in 30-minute increments; sessions may be combined with office hour sessions as needed
- Please allow 24-48 hours’ notice so materials can be prepared
<br><br>

**Office Hours Session — $70/hr**<br>
Office Hours Sessions are reactive and driven by the student’s questions or homework needs. They provide support as issues arise but do not follow a planned sequence or long-term instructional strategy. This style of session is more in line with traditional tutoring. 

- No set agenda; student brings questions or homework problems to discuss
- No prepared handouts; we work from the student’s materials
- Concepts explained only as needed with minimal sequencing or long-term planning
- Practice happens only if the student brings problems to work on 
- Gaps are addressed only if the student identifies them
- Little preparation required from the tutor before each session
- Best for highly self-motivated students who can identify their own gaps
- Billed in 30-minute increments; sessions may be combined with structured teaching sessions as needed
- Same-day scheduling may be available (subject to availability)

#### **FAQs**
**What’s the main differences between structured teaching and office hours formats?**<br>  
Structured teaching is proactive, planned one-on-one instruction with mini-lessons, guided notes, and targeted practice aligned to your syllabus and the AP rubric. Office hours are reactive sessions focused on your current questions, homework, and upcoming tests.

**Do you provide practice and solutions?**<br>  
Yes, structured teaching sessions include a targeted practice set with full solutions.

**Can I switch formats later?**<br>  
Yes, it is fine to start out in one format and adjust formats as needed. It is also fine to mix formats in one session (e.g., 30-minutes of structured teaching followed by 30 mimutes of office hours).

**Do you help with AP exam prep?**<br>
Yes, mock FRQs, multiple-choice review, timing strategies, and rubric-aligned writing will be integrated into structured teaching sessions.

**When should we start if the AP exam is months away?**
Earlier is better. Structured teaching builds skills over time; starting well before major tests avoids cramming and reduces stress—and, crucially, lets us set strong foundations in core concepts, notation, and AP-style reasoning so later units build smoothly.

**What technology do I need for online sessions?**<br>  
Zoom, a stable connection, and your class materials. I teach using an iPad with screen-sharing, so you see me work problems and annotate in real time—just like a classroom whiteboard. A notebook and a graphing calculator (e.g., TI-84) are recommended.

**Do you guarantee a specific score?**<br>
No. I focus on building skills, AP-style reasoning, and consistent study habits that historically improve outcomes.

**Can a parent/guardian sit in on the first session?**<br>
If helpful, yes. After that, most students prefer one-on-one time, with parents receiving brief updates as needed.

**How do parents stay in the loop?**<br>
Upon request, I can send brief progress notes (key wins, upcoming targets) after structured teaching sessions or milestone assessments.

**Do you offer group sessions?**<br>
My default is one-on-one for the best outcomes. Limited small-group options may be available if students are in the same class and pace.

**Do you work with non-AP statistics?**<br>  
Yes, I can work with any student of statistics!
