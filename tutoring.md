#### **My Background & Teaching Approach**
I hold an M.S. in Statistics (University of Washington) and a B.S. in Mathematics (University of Nevada, Reno). As a former TA for college-level introductory statistics (i.e., the equivalent of AP Statistics), I led weekly discussion and problem-solving sections for 100+ students, ran exam reviews, and emphasized clear, rubric-aligned reasoning. I also mentored through UW's Statistics & Probability Association Directed Reading Program, designing and teaching a one-on-one short course in statistical learning. Through these experiences, I've developed a strong ability to translate complex statistical concepts into clear, step-by-step explanations with guided practice, connecting intuition to formulas, highlighting common pitfalls, and modeling the justification. Underpinning this is a strong theoretical foundation in probability and statistical inference, which I use to explain not just how methods work, but **why**, so students build durable understanding, not just procedures.

#### **Tutoring Format**
The tutoring services I offer are slightly different than traditional tutoring. Traditional tutoring is often reactive, student-led, question-and-answer. This requires the student to identify their own gaps in knowledge, which is often challenging for students. The services I provide are proactive, one-on-one instruction with planned mini-lessons, custom handouts, targeted practice with solutions, and rubric-aligned AP reasoning, specifically built to stay ahead of class pacing, close gaps early, and build exam-ready habits.

**Private Lesson — $140/hr**<br>
These lessons are proactive and pre-planned around the AP curriculum, class pacing, and anticipated challenges. They focus on building skills, mastering AP-specific language, and reinforcing concepts before gaps form. This style of session is more in line with private, one-on-one teaching. Each private lesson includes these three components:

- **Lecture (10-15 minutes).** Concise exposition of the topic establishing formal definitions, notation, and requisite conditions, and outlining the standard analytical workflow and justification structure. A brief canonical example fixes ideas before moving to worked examples and practice.<br>
- **Instructor-led problem-solving (0-10 minutes).** If the student prefers, the instructor works a few exemplar problems, modeling setup (e.g., identify parameter, hypotheses, conditions), method choice, calculator steps (e.g., TI-84), mechanics, and a conclusion in context. Instructor calls out rubric-earning statements, shows common mistakes and how to self-check (units, direction, reasonableness), and, when useful, contrast an alternative approach so the student sees why the chosen method fits.<br>
- **Student practice with instructor support (35-50 minutes).** The student solves similar problems live while the instructor steps in where needed, asking targeted questions, correcting course, and reinforcing rubric-aligned reasoning. This phase is essential in mathematics and statistics: doing the work yourself strengthens concept-to-notation links, exposes misconceptions instantly, and builds independent problem-solving. The student leaves able to show each step and justify conclusions in AP style.

Each session's lecture notes, worked examples with solutions, and practice problems with solutions are provided as PDFs after each lesson for the student to keep via DropBox file sharing.

#### **How we'll work together**

1. Parent(s) and/or student reach out with class, schedule, and goals.  
2. Schedule a 10-15 minute virtual meet-and-greet with parent(s) and student.
3. Create a plan aligned to the student's needs.
4. For each lesson, the student notifies me of the target topic at least 48 hours in advance; we confirm and schedule the session and repeat.

#### **FAQs**
**Do you offer in-person private lessons?**<br>Online is my default for time efficiency, but limited in-person sessions within Seattle may be available on a case-by-case at a premium rate and subject to availability.

**Do you help with AP exam prep?**<br>Yes, mock FRQs, multiple-choice review, timing strategies, and rubric-aligned writing will be integrated into structured teaching sessions.

**When should we start if the AP exam is months away?**<br>Earlier is better. Private lessons build skills over time; starting well before major tests avoids cramming and reduces stress, and, crucially, lets us set strong foundations in core concepts, notation, and AP-style reasoning so later units build smoothly.

**What technology do I need for online sessions?**<br>Zoom, a stable connection, and your class materials. I teach using an iPad with screen-sharing, so you see me work problems and annotate in real time—just like a classroom whiteboard. A notebook and a graphing calculator (e.g., TI-84) are recommended.

**Do you guarantee a specific score?**<br>No. I focus on building skills, AP-style reasoning, and consistent study habits that historically improve outcomes.

**How do parents stay in the loop?**<br>Upon request, I can send brief progress notes after sessions or milestone assessments.

**Do you offer group sessions?**<br>My default is one-on-one for the best outcomes. Limited small-group options may be available if students are in the same class and pace.

**Could you support students taking AP Calculus?**<br>Possibly, please reach out if you're interested!
