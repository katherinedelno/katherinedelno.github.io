title: Premium One-on-One Statistics Instruction
permalink: /tutoring/
---

**Overview**<br>
I provide one-on-one statistics instruction for motivated high school and early college students, with a focus on AP Statistics and introductory statistics. Sessions are structured, instructor-led, and designed to build durable statistical reasoning. **Sessions are held over Zoom; materials and notes are shared through a private Dropbox folder.**
<br>

**My Background & Teaching Approach**<br>
I hold an M.S. in Statistics (University of Washington) and a B.S. in Mathematics (University of Nevada, Reno), with formal training in probability, statistical inference, and regression modeling. I previously served as a graduate teaching assistant for large introductory statistics courses, leading weekly discussion sections and supporting large-course instruction with an emphasis on clear reasoning and correct statistical communication. I have also mentored through UW’s Directed Reading Program, designing and teaching a one-on-one short course in statistical learning. Across these roles, I focus on helping students connect intuition to formal methods, state assumptions explicitly, and produce precise, well-justified solutions.
<br>

**Who This Is For**<br>
I primarily support AP Statistics and college-level introductory statistics. I’m a strong fit for students who want proactive, structured support, and who need to improve method selection, notation, and written explanations.
<br>

**Course Support Options**<br>
My default approach is a structured weekly program that functions more like a mini-class than drop-in homework help. Each session includes clear instruction, guided practice, and an independent check so students build reliable method selection and strong statistical writing rather than only working through individual problems. Choose **Structured Course Support** for consistent instruction and comprehensive session notes. Choose **Premium Course Support** if the student benefits from a fuller feedback loop, including assigned practice, accountability, and between-session support, especially when the class moves quickly or instruction is unclear. All sessions are billed monthly; invoices are sent on the 1st of each month.
<br>

**Structured Course Support — $180/week**<br>
Weekly instruction and organized notes; ideal for students who want consistent teaching and guided practice, without between-session coaching.<br>
- **Weekly 90-minute structured sessions.** Sessions are pre-planned and instructor-led, typically combining a brief review of key definitions and conditions, targeted guided practice on representative problems, and a short independent check-in at the end. Materials are aligned with the student’s course pacing and customized to the specific skill gaps and recurring errors I observe.<br>
  - **Mini-lecture.** A brief, high-signal review of the topic’s key definitions, notation, and conditions, plus the standard workflow and justification structure used on assessments.<br>
  - **Guided problem-solving.** The student works representative problems live while I provide targeted prompts and corrections to reinforce correct method selection and rubric-aligned reasoning.<br>
  - **End-of-session quiz.** The final 10-15 minutes are a short independent check-in (2-4 AP-style problems), followed by a quick review together to confirm what’s correct, fix errors, and clarify any sticking points.<br>
- **Session notes and solutions.** After each session, I upload a printable set of notes to the student’s shared Dropbox folder, including the mini-lecture summary, guided problem-solving (with solutions), and the end-of-session quiz (with solutions), so they can review and reference everything between meetings.<br>
- **TI-84 Plus CE integration.** I teach students how to use the TI-84 Plus CE efficiently for AP Statistics—especially key statistics and probability functions—so they can handle complex calculations confidently and avoid avoidable test-day mistakes.<br>
- **Best fit:** Students who mainly need clear instruction and guided practice, and can follow through on practice independently.
<br>

**Premium Course Support — $220/week**<br>
Includes everything in Structured Course Support, plus:

- **Weekly assigned problem sets.** Short, targeted practice sets (typically 6-10 problems) chosen to reinforce the exact skills we covered and expose common AP-style traps are assigned weekly. The student submits their solutions by an agreed-upon deadline; I review their work and give feedback on method choice, setup, and interpretation so we can correct patterns quickly and make the next session more efficient.<br>
- **Between-session support.** I’m available for quick questions or clarifications on weekdays between sessions so the student doesn’t get stuck and lose momentum. Weekend messages are welcome too, but may have longer response times.<br>
- **Method summary sheet updates.** We maintain a running “method sheet” that summarizes when to use each procedure, the key conditions to check, and the standard justification/interpretation wording. It’s designed for quick review before quizzes/tests and to reduce repeat mistakes.<br>
- **Monthly parent update.** Once per month, parents can choose a 20-minute virtual check-in (meeting or call) or a brief written progress note covering what we’ve worked on, current strengths/weak spots, and next steps.<br>
- **Best fit:** Students who need clear instruction and guided practice, as well as accountability, feedback loops, and structure between sessions.
<br>

**As-Needed Support (Limited) — $90/hr**<br>
For students who are generally self-directed and want occasional help with specific questions (homework, quiz/test review, or a topic currently being covered). This format is student-led rather than a structured weekly program.

- **Best for targeted questions.** Students come prepared with specific problems and attempted work, so we can use time efficiently and focus on clarifying method selection and improving setup and explanations.<br>
- **Student-led agenda.** We use the session to confirm the correct method, check conditions, set up the calculator steps, and produce rubric-aligned conclusions.<br>
- **Explanation and setup coaching.** Emphasis on correct procedure selection, conditions, calculator execution, and rubric-aligned conclusions.<br>
- **Limited availability.** As-needed sessions are offered selectively and may not be available every week, especially near major exam dates.<br>
- **Not ideal for ongoing skill-building.** If a student needs consistent structure, assigned practice, accountability, or their course instruction/pacing makes it hard to learn the material cleanly, Structured Course Support or Premium Course Support is typically the better fit and produces more reliable progress.
- **Best fit:** Self-directed students who come prepared with specific questions and do not need weekly structure, assigned practice, or between-session feedback.

**Academic Progress & No Guaranteed Outcomes**<br>
My goal is to help students build durable understanding, stronger problem-solving habits, and clearer statistical communication—skills that often translate into improved performance over time. I provide high-quality instruction, targeted practice, and actionable feedback aligned with the student’s course expectations and goals.<br><br>
That said, I cannot and do not guarantee any specific grade, test score, class placement, or AP exam result. Outcomes depend on many factors outside my control, including the student’s consistency between sessions, completion of assigned work, attendance, classroom instruction and grading policies, assessment difficulty, pacing, and test-day conditions.<br><br>
By enrolling, families are purchasing instructional time and academic coaching, not a promised outcome. I’m always happy to discuss goals up front, share what I’m observing, and adjust our approach as we learn what helps the student most.<br>
