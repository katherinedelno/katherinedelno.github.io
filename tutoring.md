title: Premium One-on-One Statistics Instruction
permalink: /tutoring/
---

**Overview**<br>
I provide one-on-one statistics instruction for motivated high school and early college students, with a focus on AP Statistics and introductory statistics. Sessions are structured, instructor-led, and designed to build durable statistical reasoning.

<br>

**My Background & Teaching Approach**<br>
I hold an M.S. in Statistics (University of Washington) and a B.S. in Mathematics (University of Nevada, Reno), with formal training in probability, statistical inference, and regression modeling. I previously served as a graduate teaching assistant for large introductory statistics courses, leading weekly discussion sections and supporting large-course instruction with an emphasis on clear reasoning and correct statistical communication. I have also mentored through UW’s Directed Reading Program, designing and teaching a one-on-one short course in statistical learning. Across these roles, I focus on helping students connect intuition to formal methods, state assumptions explicitly, and produce precise, well-justified solutions.

<br>

**Who This Is For**<br>
I primarily support AP Statistics and college-level introductory statistics. I’m a strong fit for students who want proactive, structured support, and who need to improve method selection, notation, and written explanations.
<br>

**Packages**<br>
I take a structured, high-support approach that builds both skill and confidence. Sessions are designed like a mini-class: clear instruction, guided problem-solving, and independent checks to reinforce mastery. My **base rate is $120/hour**, and the packages below make weekly support simple and predictable; choose Standard Weekly for focused instruction, or Premium Course Support for a full feedback loop and structure between sessions.

<br>

**Standard Weekly — $680/month (4 sessions)**<br>
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions.** Sessions are structured and instructor-led, typically combining brief concept review, targeted guided practice, and an independent check-in problem. Materials are tailored to the student’s course pacing and goals.<br>
  - **Mini-lecture.** A brief, high-signal review of the topic’s key definitions, notation, and conditions, plus the standard workflow and justification structure used on assessments.<br>
  - **Guided problem-solving.** The student works representative problems live while I provide targeted prompts and corrections to reinforce correct method selection and rubric-aligned reasoning.<br>
  - **End-of-session quiz.** The final 10–15 minutes of each session is reserved for a short independent check-in (2–4 problems) to measure retention under light time pressure and identify what to tighten next.<br>
- **Session notes and solutions.** After each session, I upload a printable set of notes to the student’s shared Dropbox folder, including the mini-lecture summary, guided problem-solving (with solutions), and the end-of-session quiz (with solutions), so they can review and reference everything between meetings.<br>
- **TI-84 Plus CE integration.** I teach students how to use the TI-84 Plus CE efficiently for AP Statistics—especially key statistics and probability functions—so they can handle complex calculations confidently and avoid avoidable test-day mistakes.<br>
- **Best fit:** Students who mainly need clear instruction and guided practice, and can follow through on practice independently.

<br>

**Premium Course Support — $880/month (4 sessions)**<br>
Includes everything in Standard Weekly, plus:

- **Weekly assigned problem sets.** Short, targeted practice sets (typically 4–6 problems) chosen to reinforce the exact skills we covered and expose common AP-style traps are assigned weekly. The student submits their solutions by an agreed-upon deadline; I review their work and give feedback on method choice, setup, and interpretation so we can correct patterns quickly and make the next session more efficient.<br>
- **Method summary sheet updates.** We maintain a running “method sheet” that summarizes when to use each procedure, the key conditions to check, and the standard justification/interpretation wording. It’s designed for quick review before quizzes/tests and to reduce repeat mistakes.<br>
- **Between-session support.** I’m available for quick questions or clarifications on weekdays between sessions so the student doesn’t get stuck and lose momentum. Weekend messages are welcome too, but may have longer response times.<br>
- **Monthly parent update.** Once per month, parents can choose a 20-minute virtual check-in (meeting or call) or a brief written progress note covering what we’ve worked on, current strengths/weak spots, and next steps.<br>
- **Best fit:** Students who need clear instruction and guided practice, as well as accountability, feedback loops, and structure between sessions.

<br>

**Private Lesson — $120/hr**<br>
For families who prefer flexibility (as-needed sessions rather than a weekly plan). Sessions are structured and instructor-led, and can be scheduled as availability allows.
