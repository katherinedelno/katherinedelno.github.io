title: Premium One-on-One Statistics Instruction
permalink: /tutoring/

**Overview**<br>
I provide one-on-one statistics instruction for motivated high school and early college students, with a focus on AP Statistics and introductory statistics. Sessions are structured, instructor-led, and designed to build durable statistical reasoning.

<br>

**My Background & Teaching Approach**<br>
I hold an M.S. in Statistics (University of Washington) and a B.S. in Mathematics (University of Nevada, Reno), with formal training in probability, statistical inference, and regression modeling. I previously served as a graduate teaching assistant for college-level introductory statistics, leading weekly discussion sections and supporting large-course instruction with an emphasis on clear reasoning and correct statistical communication. I have also mentored through UW’s Directed Reading Program, designing and guiding a one-on-one introduction to statistical learning. Across these roles, I focus on helping students connect intuition to formal methods, state assumptions explicitly, and produce precise, well-justified solutions.

**Private Lesson — $120/hr**<br>
Sessions are structured and instructor-led, typically combining brief concept review, targeted guided practice, and an independent check-in problem when appropriate. Materials are tailored to the student’s course pacing and goals. Each private lesson includes:

- **Mini Lecture.** A brief, high-signal review of the topic’s key definitions, notation, and conditions, plus the standard workflow and justification structure used on assessments.<br>

- **Guided Problem Solving.** The student works representative problems live while I provide targeted prompts and corrections to reinforce correct method selection and rubric-aligned reasoning..<br>

- **End-of-Session Quiz.** In longer sessions, we reserve the final minutes for a short independent check-in (2–4 problems) to measure retention under light time pressure and identify what to tighten next.
