#### **Overview**
I provide one-on-one statistics instruction for motivated high school and early college students, with a focus on AP Statistics and introductory statistics. Sessions are structured, instructor-led, and designed to build durable statistical reasoning.

#### **My Background & Teaching Approach**
I hold an M.S. in Statistics (University of Washington) and a B.S. in Mathematics (University of Nevada, Reno), with a strong theoretical foundation in probability and statistical inference. As a graduate teaching assistant for college-level introductory statistics, I led weekly discussion sections and supported large-course instruction, emphasizing clear, rubric-aligned reasoning. I have also mentored through UW’s Directed Reading Program, designing and teaching a one-on-one short course in statistical learning. These experiences have sharpened my ability to translate technical ideas into precise, step-by-step explanations that connect intuition to formulas, highlight assumptions and common pitfalls, and model high-quality statistical justification.

#### **Private Lesson — $120/hr**
The tutoring services I offer are slightly different from traditional tutoring. Traditional tutoring is often reactive, student-led, question-and-answer, which requires the student to identify their own gaps in knowledge, which is a challenging task even for strong students. In contrast, these lessons are proactive, one-on-one instruction with planned mini-lessons, custom handouts, targeted practice with solutions, and rubric-aligned AP reasoning, all pre-planned around the AP curriculum, class pacing, and anticipated challenges. The goal is to stay ahead of class pacing, close gaps early, build exam-ready habits, and help students master AP-specific language and reasoning. Each private lesson includes:

- **Mini Lecture (10-15 minutes).** Concise exposition of the topic establishing formal definitions, notation, and requisite conditions, and outlining the standard analytical workflow and justification structure. A brief canonical example fixes ideas before moving to worked examples and practice.<br>

- **Guided Problem Solving (45-50 minutes).** The student solves similar problems live while the instructor steps in where needed, asking targeted questions, correcting course, and reinforcing rubric-aligned reasoning. This phase is essential in mathematics and statistics: doing the work yourself strengthens concept-to-notation links, exposes misconceptions instantly, and builds independent problem-solving. The student leaves able to show each step and justify conclusions in AP style.<br>

- **End-of-Session Quiz (10-15 minutes).** In 90-minute sessions or longer, we reserve the last 10-15 minutes for a brief quiz. The student independently solves 3-4 problems directly tied to that session’s topic under light time pressure, without instructor prompts. Once the student is finished, we go over their work together, noting what was done correctly, where reasoning or notation drifted from AP expectations, and how to tighten justifications. This creates an authentic, low-stakes exam experience and a clear snapshot of progress.
