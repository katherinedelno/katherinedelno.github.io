  <section aria-labelledby="faq">
    <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <p><strong>How is Structured different from Office Hours?</strong><br>
    Structured is proactive and planned with take-home materials; Office Hours is reactive, driven by your questions.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you provide practice and solutions?</strong><br>
    Yes — Structured sessions include a targeted practice set with full solutions. Office Hours uses the student’s materials.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I switch formats later?</strong><br>
    Absolutely. Many students do a weekly Structured session and add Office Hours before tests.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you help with test prep near the AP exam?</strong><br>
    Yes — mock FRQs, multiple-choice review, timing strategies, and rubric-aligned writing.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you work with non-AP statistics?</strong><br>
    Yes — foundations and honors-level statistics. The focus of this page is AP Statistics.</p>
