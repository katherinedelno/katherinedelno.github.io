### **My Background & Teaching Approach**
I hold an M.S. in Statistics (University of Washington) and a B.S. in Mathematics (University of Nevada, Reno). As a former TA for college-level introductory statistics (i.e., the equivalent of AP Statistics), I led weekly discussion and problem-solving sections for 100+ students, ran exam reviews, and emphasized clear, rubric-aligned reasoning. I also mentored through UW's Statistics & Probability Association Directed Reading Program, designing and teaching a one-on-one short course in statistical learning. Through these experiences, I've developed a strong ability to translate complex statistical concepts into clear, step-by-step explanations with guided practice, connecting intuition to formulas, highlighting common pitfalls, and modeling the justification. Underpinning this is a strong theoretical foundation in probability and statistical inference, which I use to explain not just how methods work, but **why**, so students build durable understanding, not just procedures.

#### **Private Lesson — $110/hr**
The tutoring services I offer are slightly different from traditional tutoring. Traditional tutoring is often reactive, student-led, question-and-answer, which requires the student to identify their own gaps in knowledge, which is a challenging task even for strong students. In contrast, these lessons are proactive, one-on-one instruction with planned mini-lessons, custom handouts, targeted practice with solutions, and rubric-aligned AP reasoning, all pre-planned around the AP curriculum, class pacing, and anticipated challenges. The goal is to stay ahead of class pacing, close gaps early, build exam-ready habits, and help students master AP-specific language and reasoning. Each private lesson includes:

- **Mini Lecture (10-15 minutes).** Concise exposition of the topic establishing formal definitions, notation, and requisite conditions, and outlining the standard analytical workflow and justification structure. A brief canonical example fixes ideas before moving to worked examples and practice.<br>

- **Guided Problem Solving (45-50 minutes).** The student solves similar problems live while the instructor steps in where needed, asking targeted questions, correcting course, and reinforcing rubric-aligned reasoning. This phase is essential in mathematics and statistics: doing the work yourself strengthens concept-to-notation links, exposes misconceptions instantly, and builds independent problem-solving. The student leaves able to show each step and justify conclusions in AP style.<br>

- **End-of-Session Quiz (optional, but highly recommended).** In 90-minute sessions or longer, we reserve the last 10-15 minutes for a brief quiz. The student independently solves 2-3 problems directly tied to that session’s topic under light time pressure, without instructor prompts. Once the student is finished, we go over their work together, noting what was done correctly, where reasoning or notation drifted from AP expectations, and how to tighten justifications. This creates an authentic, low-stakes exam experience and a clear snapshot of progress.
For 60-minute lessons, we may instead use a single “exit ticket” problem at the end of the session so as to keep most of the time focused on guided practice while still giving the student one fully independent check-in.

#### Optional Add-On: Custom Problem Sets & Written Feedback
Many students benefit from structured practice and accountability between lessons. For families who want this, I offer custom problem sets aligned with each session and written feedback on the student’s work. This includes:

- A short, targeted assignment between sessions of 3-8 problems;
- Clear expectations on how and when to submit work;
- Graded feedback highlighting strengths, common errors, and how to polish AP-style justification. 

Because this requires additional time outside of our meetings, custom problem set design and grading are billed separately from the lesson itself, typically billed at half my hourly-rate, or $70 per full assignment. This includes 5-8 problems with grading and brief written comments. Light problem suggestions from existing materials are always included during sessions at no extra charge, but often it requires structured and designed problem sets with accountability for the student to fully benefit.

#### File Sharing
Every session is taught from materials **custom-designed for that student**: lecture notes, worked examples, practice problems, and any end-of-session quiz. After each lesson, the exact documents used in session are provided to the student as PDFs to keep and reuse. Students are encouraged to print these packets and refer back to them frequently as a personalized notebook. All files are organized and shared via a dedicated Dropbox folder shared between the instructor, student, and parents (if desired).

### **How we'll work together**

1. **Initial contact.** Parent(s) and student reach out with basic information about the course and general scheduling constraints.
2. **10-15 minute virtual or in-person meet-and-greet.** We talk through goals, prior experience, and what’s been challenging so far. This is also a chance to confirm fit and answer any questions about how I teach.
3. **Course snapshot & planning.** The student/parent shares the class syllabus, grading policies, and a few recent assignments or tests (photos or PDFs are fine). I use these to map the course’s pacing onto the AP curriculum, identify early trouble spots, and build a plan tailored to the student.
4. **Standing schedule & weekly topic check-in.** We set a regular lesson time. At least 48 hours before each session, the student sends the current or upcoming class topic and 2-3 representative homework or review problems they find challenging. I then prepare custom notes, examples, and practice around that material. If no specific topic is sent, I continue along the AP-aligned plan based on the syllabus and the student’s recent work, staying slightly ahead of class where possible.

### **Contact & Booking**
If you’re interested in working together, please email me at [delnokatherine@gmail.com](mailto:delnokatherine@gmail.com) with a brief note about the course, school, and your preferred days/times. Availability is limited, so I recommend reaching out early, especially if you’re hoping to reserve a weekly spot.
<br><br><br>

### **Policies & Logistics**

#### **Session length & format**
- Standard session length is **60 minutes**; sessions may be extended in 30-minute increments, as scheduling permits.  
- Many students find **90-minute lessons** to be the “sweet spot” for balancing brief lecture, guided practice, and an end-of-session quiz.  
- All meetings are held **virtually via Zoom**.
- Limited **in-person sessions** within Seattle may be available on a case-by-case at a premium rate and subject to availability.
<br><br>

#### **Scheduling, rescheduling, & cancellations**
- Students are strongly encouraged to reserve a **standing weekly lesson time** to ensure continuity and priority scheduling.  
- At least **48 hours before each session**, the student sends the current or upcoming class topic and 2–3 representative homework or review problems they find challenging so I can prepare custom materials.  
- As-needed sessions are available when my schedule allows, but weekly students receive priority for time slots.  
- At least **24 hours’ notice** is requested for cancellations or rescheduling.  
- If a session is canceled with less than 24 hours’ notice but rescheduled within the same week, there is no cancellation fee, subject to availability.  
- If a session is canceled with less than 24 hours’ notice and not rescheduled within the same week, 50% of the session fee is billed to account for time spent preparing custom materials.
<br><br>

#### **Billing**
- For students on a weekly schedule, invoices are emailed on the **1st of each month** for the prior month’s lessons.  
- For students on an as-needed schedule, invoices are emailed after each session.  
- Payment details and due dates are included on each invoice.
<br><br>

#### **Materials & file sharing**

### **FAQs**
**Do you offer in-person private lessons?**<br>Online is my default for time efficiency, but limited in-person sessions within Seattle may be available on a case-by-case at a premium rate and subject to availability.

**Do you offer any reduced rates?**<br>I know that high-quality, specialized instruction is a meaningful investment. I maintain a small number of reduced-rate spots each year for families with demonstrated financial need. If cost is a barrier, please contact me to see whether one of these spots is available or to discuss what might be possible.

**When should we start if the AP exam is months away?**<br>Earlier is better. Private lessons build skills over time; starting well before major tests avoids cramming and reduces stress, and, crucially, lets us set strong foundations in core concepts, notation, and AP-style reasoning so later units build smoothly.

**What technology do I need for online sessions?**<br>Zoom, a stable connection, and notebook and writing utensil. I teach using an iPad with screen-sharing, so you see me work problems and annotate in real time—just like a classroom whiteboard. A notebook and a graphing calculator (e.g., TI-84) are recommended.

**Do you guarantee a specific score?**<br>No. I focus on building skills, AP-style reasoning, and consistent study habits that historically improve outcomes.

**How do parents stay in the loop?**<br>Upon request, I can send brief progress notes after sessions or milestone assessments.

**Do you offer group sessions?**<br>My default is one-on-one for the best outcomes. Limited small-group options may be available if students are in the same class and pace.

**Could you support students taking AP Calculus?**<br>Possibly, please reach out if you're interested!
