#### FAQ
**What’s the difference between structured teaching and office hours formats?**  
Structured is proactive with prepared materials; Office Hours is reactive and driven by your questions.

**Do you provide practice and solutions?**  
Yes, structured teaching sessions include a targeted practice set with full solutions.

**Can I switch formats later?**

**Do you help with AP exam prep?**  
Yes, mock FRQs, multiple-choice review, timing strategies, and rubric-aligned writing will be integrated into structured teaching sessions.

**Do you work with non-AP statistics?**  
Yes, I can work with any student in statistics!
