#### **Tutoring Formats**
**Structured Teaching — $120/hr**<br>
Structured Teaching Sessions are proactive and pre-planned around the AP curriculum, class pacing, and anticipated challenges. They focus on building skills, mastering AP-specific language, and reinforcing concepts before gaps form. This style of session is more in line with private, one-on-one teaching. 

- Sessions are pre-planned around the AP curriculum, class pacing, and anticipated challenges
- Includes short, targeted mini-lessons on upcoming or difficult topics, plus AP exam strategies
- Includes guided notes and a targeted practice set (with solutions) that the student keeps
- Integrates AP-specific vocabulary and exam-style reasoning
- Provides guided practice with AP-style questions and immediate feedback
- Tutor proactively identifies gaps before they cause issues
- Requires substantial preparation outside of sessions to create lectures, select topics, and source materials
- Best for students new to AP coursework or who benefit from consistent structure
- Designed to ensure the student can both solve problems and clearly explain reasoning in the style required to earn maximum points on the AP exam
- Billed in 30-minute increments; sessions may be combined with office hour sessions as needed
- Please allow 24-48 hours’ notice so materials can be prepared
<br><br>

**Office Hours — $70/hr**<br>
Office Hour Sessions are reactive and driven by the student’s questions or homework needs. They provide support as issues arise but do not follow a planned sequence or long-term instructional strategy. This style of session is more in line with traditional tutoring. 

- No set agenda; student brings questions or homework problems to discuss
- No prepared handouts; we work from the student’s materials
- Concepts explained only as needed with minimal sequencing or long-term planning
- Practice happens only if the student brings problems to work on 
- Gaps are addressed only if the student identifies them
- Little preparation required from the tutor before each session
- Best for highly self-motivated students who can identify their own gaps
- Billed in 30-minute increments; sessions may be combined with structured teaching sessions as needed
- Same-day scheduling may be available (subject to availability)

#### **FAQ**
**What’s the difference between structured teaching and office hours formats?**

**Do you provide practice and solutions?**

Yes, mock FRQs, multiple-choice review, timing strategies, and rubric-aligned writing will be integrated into structured teaching sessions.

**Do you work with non-AP statistics?**  
Yes, I can work with any student in statistics!
